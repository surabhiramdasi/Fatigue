										<h2 class="major">Fatigue Analysis - Why and What?</h2>
										<p>Cyclic loading, even though lower in magnitude than the material strength can be extremely detrimental to the component structure. Fatigue analysis is important 
											to understand whether the designed component will fail under the repeated loading cycles. For example, all the engine components are subjected to repeated loads 
											from the combustion firing pressures acting on different cylinders. In addition to that, engines are also subjected to different thermal cycles which induce
											mean and alternating loads that can lead to failure. I work on designing base engine components to ensure that they will not fail under thermomechanical fatigue.
											I do a lot of this work using Simulia FE-Safe which calculates the life and FOS values for each node/element based on the stress value at that particular node/
											element. I typically work on grey iron components so it becomes imperative that the Theory of Critical Distance (TCD) is taken into account while calculating the FOS
											values. I have also worked on designing hardware rig tests that can be used to validate a component against "infinite life" by accelerating the test by incrementing
											the loads by a specific margin. I developed an analysis procedure to replace a hydraulic fatigue hardware test as part of my Six Sigma project which will eventually
											drive major cost savings.

										<h2 class="major">Critical Fastener Fatigue Failure</h2>
										<p> Critical fasteners in cylinder heads and blocks can cause fatigue failures because they normally experience high mean (assembly) and alternating loads. The bolt bosses for the 
											head bolt and main bolt are susceptible to failures and have to be designed with extreme caution. I worked on creating a repository of different head bolt and main bolt configurations 
											(15 different designs) with varying preloads and thread engagements on different engine platforms - these designs were a mix of successful and failed designs. I created a Goodman plot 
											based on the mean and alternating stresses at the last engaged thread which showed a clear demarcation between good and bad designs. This 
											procedure is currently being used to predict failures for all NPI programs and has shown promising results so far.

										<h2 class="major">Engine Accessory Design</h2>
										<p>I have designed auxiliary engine components like oil pans, flywheel housings and lifting brackets in the Current Product space. I curated the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVP&R) for various
											components based on the changes that were being made to the design. I also have experience with designing plumbing options such as coolant lines and oil suction tubes.
											I have employed DFA and DFM principles while working on these designs. I am also familiar with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Root Cause Analysis procedures.
